# Challenge

## Hangman

The object of hangman is to guess the secret word before the stick figure is hung. Players take turns selecting letters to narrow the word down.

## Objectives

- Implement all game mechanics
- Pick the words from the words.json
- Controls using mouse and keyboard
- Give the user an option to reset the game
- If the word has not been guessed show the word when the user has lost
- Let users save and view highscores (save them in a json file)
    - Highscore is the amount of wrong letters. So a lower score is better.
- Use clean Git guidelines, e.g. branches, clear commit messages, splitting up codes to simple commits, etc.
